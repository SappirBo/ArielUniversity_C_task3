# ArielUniversity_C_task3
This is the third project in C programing course (on linux), about Strings.
The projects main functions are:
* [Gematric Sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria)
* [Atbash Sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash) 
* [Anagram Sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)
the project include also a main.c to run the program.

To compile the program I recommend using the Makefile.\n
make all - to compile everything ans get exe name "stringProg".\n
make clean - to delete evrything (exceptthe origin files).
